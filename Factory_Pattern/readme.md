# [The Factory Method Patter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) : Creational Pattern
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Steps for creating the Pizza Factory:
### Create the Product:
**Pizza**
### Create the Concrete Products:
All the products produced by a concrete creator:

**- NYCheesePizza**

**- NYClamPizza**

**- ChicagoCheesePizza**

**- ChicagoClamPizza**

...
### Create the Creator:
**Pizza Store**

This is the one responsible for creating the abstract *Factory Method*(`createPizza()`).

The creator never really knows which concrete product was produced.

### Create the Concrete Creators
**Pizza Stores**

These are responsible for overriding the base *Factory Method* so it returns a different type of product. The *Factory Method* is the one responsible for producing products. 

Note that the *Factory Method* doesnâ€™t have to create new instances all the time. It can also return existing objects from a cache, an object pool, or another source.

The Concrete Creators are the only ones with knowledge of how to create the Concrete Products.
